  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p style="text-align:left;">
    Data Science employs techniques from many fields that are so numerous that they make your head hurt.
    So wouldn't be nice if there was a way for all these techniques to share their data and intent.
    The answer is Reactive Streams that govern streams of data, especially “live” data with a publish and subscribe approach
    that promotes data interaction while allowing the techniques and their dependencies to remain decoupled.

    Reactive Streams operate at many levels: in the browser with RxJS, on the server with RxJava and in big data with Apache Spark streaming.

    So to introduce reactive streams  I will demonstrate RxJS in the browser with a Leaflet GIS application.
    I choose GIS because it constantly wrestles with the interaction of spatial and thematic data.
    Moreover I will show how to stream in the users interactive intent.

  <h2>The Reactive Manifesto</h2>
  <a href="http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/">www.reactivemanifesto.org/</a>
  <img src ="lib/images/ReactiveManifesto.jpg">
  <ul style="text-align:left; font-size:24px;">
    <li>Responsive: The system responds in a timely manner if at all possible.</li>
    <li>Resilient: The system stays responsive in the face of failure.</li>
    <li>Elastic: The system stays responsive under varying workload.</li>
    <li>Message Driven: Reactive Systems rely on asynchronous message-passing to establish a boundary
        between components that ensures loose coupling, isolation, location transparency, and provides
        the means to delegate errors as messages.</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="text-align:left; font-size:24px;">
    Reactive Streams address the Message Driven part.

    Reactive Streams is an initiative to provide a standard for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking back pressure.

  <h2>What is Data Science?</h2>
  <p style="text-align:left; font-size:18px;">
    Data science is, in general terms, the extraction of knowledge from data. It employs techniques and theories drawn
    from many fields within the broad areas of mathematics, statistics, and information technology, including signal processing,
    probability models, machine learning, statistical learning, computer programming, data engineering, pattern recognition and
    learning, visualization, uncertainty modeling, data warehousing, and high performance computing.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align:left; font-size:18px;">
    Data science is the practice of deriving valuable insights from data. Data science is emerging to meet the challenges of
    processing very large data sets i.e. "Big Data" consisting of structured, unstructured or semi-structured data that large
    enterprises produce. A domain at center stage of data science is the explosion of new data generated from smart devices,
    web, mobile and social media. Data science requires a versatile skill-set. Many practicing data scientists commonly specialize
    in specific domains such as the fields of marketing, medical, security, fraud and finance. However, data scientists rely heavily
    upon elements of statistics, machine learning, optimization, signal processing, text retrieval and natural language processing
    to analyze data and interpret results.

  <h2>Data Science Research Areas</h2>
  <p>As an interdisciplinary subject, data science draws scientific inquiry from a broad range of academic subject areas,
    mostly related to the hard sciences. Some areas of research are:</p>
  <ul style="margin-left:0.6em; font-size:26px;">
    <li>Cloud computing</li>
    <li>Databases and information integration</li>
    <li>Signal Processing</li>
    <li>Learning, natural language processing and information extraction</li>
    <li>Computer vision</li>
    <li>Information retrieval and web information access</li>
    <li>Knowledge discovery in social and information networks</li>
    <li>Information Visualization</li>

  <h2>RxJS The Need to Go Reactive</h2>
  <a href="https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS">https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS</a>
  <p style="text-align:left;">
    Applications, especially on the web have changed over the years from being a simple static page, to DHTML with animations,
    to the Ajax revolution. Each time, we're adding more complexity, more data, and asynchronous behavior to our applications.
    How do we manage it all? How do we scale it? By moving towards "Reactive Architectures" which are event-driven, resilient
    and responsive. With the Reactive Extensions, you have all the tools you need to help build these systems.

  <h2>About RxJS</h2>
  <a href="https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS">https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS</a>
  <p style="text-align:left; font-size:14pt;">
    The Reactive Extensions for JavaScript (RxJS) is a set of libraries for composing asynchronous and event-based programs
    using observable sequences and fluent query operators that many of you already know by Array#extras in JavaScript.
    Using RxJS, developers represent asynchronous data streams with Observables, query asynchronous data streams using our
    many operators, and parameterize the concurrency in the asynchronous data streams using Schedulers.

    Simply put, RxJS = Observables + Operators + Schedulers.

    Whether you are authoring a web-based application in JavaScript or a server-side application in Node.js,
    you have to deal with asynchronous and event-based programming as a matter of course. Although some patterns
    are emerging such as the Promise pattern, handling exceptions, cancellation, and synchronization is difficult and error-prone.

    Using RxJS, you can represent multiple asynchronous data streams (that come from diverse sources, e.g., stock quote,
    tweets, computer events, web service requests, etc.), and subscribe to the event stream using the Observer object.
    The Observable notifies the subscribed Observer instance whenever an event occurs.

    Because observable sequences are data streams, you can query them using standard query operators implemented by the Observable type.
    Thus you can filter, project, aggregate, compose and perform time-based operations on multiple events easily by using these operators.
    In addition, there are a number of other reactive stream specific operators that allow powerful queries to be written.
    Cancellation, exceptions, and synchronization are also handled gracefully by using the methods on the Observable object.
