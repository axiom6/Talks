      Applications, especially on the web have changed over the years from being a simple static page, to DHTML with animations,
      to the Ajax revolution. Each time, we&apos;re adding more complexity, more data, and asynchronous behavior to our applications.
      How do we manage it all? How do we scale it? By moving towards &quot;Reactive Architectures&quot; which are event-driven, resilient
      and responsive. With the Reactive Extensions, you have all the tools you need to help build these systems.
