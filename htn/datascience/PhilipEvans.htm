      <h4>by Philip Evans <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/philip_evans_how_data_will_transform_business">TED talk on Nov. 2013</a></h4>
      <ul style="font-size:24px;">
        <li>Since the 1970s, business strategy has been dominated by two major theories:
          <ol>
            <li>Bruce Henderson&apos;s idea of increasing returns to scale and experience</li>
            <li>Michael Porter&apos;s value chain driven by transaction cost reductions</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>... a new force will rule business strategy in the future:
          <ol start="3">
            <li>The massive amount of data shared by competing groups</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The key driver is the 100 fold increase in data placed under URI&apos;s in the last 10 years</li>
        <li>Even better: This increases the number of patterns by 10,000 = 100x100 fold</li>
      </ul>
