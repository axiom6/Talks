        <p>Spark is hyped as the next &quot;Big Thing&quot; in &quot;Big Data&quot;. Well all of it is true.</p>

        <p>With in memory computing, resilient data sets, streaming, data frames, machine learning, rich numerical
          algorithms, Akka and Scala backed by a large dedicated community of committers, Spark is defining the next
          generation of &quot;Big Data&quot;.</p>

        <p>&quot;Big Data&quot; is forecast to become a 50 billion dollar industry with ensuing hype that all you need to do
          is set up Spark, hire few analysts and throw a ton of data at it and divine business patterns will emerge.
          Nothing could be farther from the truth.</p>

        <p>Data Science - the revealing of knowledge from data, is an interdisciplinary approach that takes us through
          a challenging but rewarding exploration of data. Brute force often circumvents this journey only to impart
          risk and devalue knowledge. So don&apos;t let brute force do your thinking for you. &quot;Big Data&quot; is not &quot;Smart Data&quot;</p>

        <p>So the purpose of this talk is to convey the good news that Spark in standalone mode is also a good platform
          to seek out &quot;Smart Data&quot; with exploratory Data Science. Spark&apos;s best features: RDDs (Resilient Data Sets) and
          streaming, manage data and apply algorithms in simple, consistent and scalable ways.</p>

        <p>This talk illustrates Spark Streaming</p>
